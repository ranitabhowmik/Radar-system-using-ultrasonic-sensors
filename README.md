Revolutionizing radar technology,the project introduces a groundbreaking system, merging Ultrasonic waves and Arduino boards for precise, efficient, and cost-effective object detection. 
Beyond heightened object detection, this project finds applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and home security, unlocking possibilities previously constrained by traditional 
radar limitations.In this project, ultrasonic sensors emit high-frequency sound waves and their reflections are detected to determine the presence and distance of objects. Arduino, a versatile microcontroller
platform, serves as the system's brain, interfacing with sensors, processing data, and executing commands. This fusion of ultrasonics and Arduino enhances object detection precision while offering a
cost-effective alternative to traditional radio systems.
